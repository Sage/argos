The resulting system is as follows:</p>\n\n<p><p><img src=\"guides/v3_scene_layout_pane/scene_layout_pane_flow.png\" alt=\"Scene Layout Pane\"></p></p>\n\n<h2 id='v3_scene_layout_pane-section-1'>Scene</h2>\n\n<p>Scene is at the top and controls the view instances - registering, showing, getting, customizing, all happens here. It has a child component - Layout.</p>\n\n<p>When a new view is to be shown Scene will do a bit of investigative work as to how to handle this views navigation and history. It has a lot of fancy\njedi tricks to recreate the shortest history path to the view combination that is being shown.</p>\n\n<p>After it takes care of that it determines what the view set should be - this includes looking at the view instances tier to determine where in the set the view\nshould go. For example, if I have a two-column app (50/50) with the app showing A and B and a call to show C to replace B is called:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// old view set\n[A, B] // [0] = tier 0, [1] = tier 1\n\n// new view set\n// what tier is view C? C.tier == 1\n[A, C]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Scene then passes this new view set to Layout to handle the rest.</p>\n\n<h2 id='v3_scene_layout_pane-section-2'>Layout</h2>\n\n<p>Layout is the organizer cog in this system, it is made up of Panes which define the \"viewport\". Meaning you can set up a 3-column wide app or 2-row app\nbased on how you setup Layout.</p>\n\n<p>It recieves the view set from Scene then does a bit of investigative work to see what sort of transitions should be applied.</p>\n\n<p>Following the example above it would see that A did not change and should not recieve any transition effects. The B -> C change is found and it's Pane\ntransition is set to <code>slide</code>.</p>\n\n<p>With the transitions in place it then identifies which Pane the views should be placed into and calls the appropiate show method of each Pane.</p>\n\n<h2 id='v3_scene_layout_pane-section-3'>Pane</h2>\n\n<p>Panes are view containers and they make up the layout of the app. Panes are matched to views by the <code>tier</code> property. As mentioned under Scene, the\nview history is a set of views where the tier number is the index in the set. If a tier is not set (false) the Pane is untracked and must be explicity called when\nshowing the view (see showView, at param).</p>\n\n<p>When thinking of Pane layouts take into consideration that not all Panes need to be visible, tracked, full screen or any other limiting factor - they are open\nto any creative styling and setup. For example the <a href=\"#!/api/argos.DialogPane\" rel=\"argos.DialogPane\" class=\"docClass\">DialogPane</a> is hidden by default and when shown it appears over the entire app with\na masked translucent background.</p>\n\n<p>Let the creativity flow! You do not need to be restricted to any design (mockups made with <a href=\"http://www.balsamiq.com/\">balsamiq</a>:</p>\n\n<h3>Complex Single Page</h3>\n\n<p><p><img src=\"guides/v3_scene_layout_pane/complex_single_page.png\" alt=\"Complex Single Page\"></p></p>\n\n<p>Example of using a single page with static left/right side bars and full bottom tab navigation. Only the center content is tracked in history, the static\npanes would be called directly with the appropriate views.</p>\n\n<h3>Complex Multi Page</h3>\n\n<p><p><img src=\"guides/v3_scene_layout_pane/complex_multi_page.png\" alt=\"Complex Multi Page\"></p></p>\n\n<p>Example of using a List selection at the bottom with a large Detail - also utilizes a static graph and nav panes. The changes in the List and Detail panes\nwould be tracked to history, the nav would be static and the info could change by list/detail views as needed.</p>\n","title":"Scene, Layout and Panes"});
