# Setup
The following will be aimed at Windows 7 users, but in general the concepts will mirror across to other systems.

## Folder Structure
For development the easiest folder setup is:
![Folder Structure](http://sage.github.com/argos/images/template-guide/setup_folders.png)


### Work it!

1.	Create a folder called `mobile` and within that, create a folder called `argos-sdk` and a folder called `products`.

2.	You should now have `\mobile`, `\mobile\argos-sdk` and `\mobile\products`.

## SDK Download
Now we need to get the SDK in there. The code will always be available at github.com at the following address:
[https://github.com/Sage/argos-sdk/downloads](https://github.com/Sage/argos-sdk/downloads)

### Work it!

1.	Open the link and click `Download as zip` for the "dev lastest" or select one of the pre-built downloads for a specific versioned release.

2.	Unzip the zipped folder â€“ ignore the name of the zip file as github may append a hash.

3.	Place all the contents into our fresh `\mobile\argos-sdk` folder.

## Template Download
To get the ball rolling a bare-bones application has been made as a starting point called argos-template. You may download the zip from its github download page:
[https://github.com/Sage/argos-template/downloads](https://github.com/Sage/argos-template/downloads)

### Work it!

1.	Go inside your `\mobile\products` folder and create a new folder called `argos-template`;

2.	Follow the download link and click `Download as zip`; and

3.	Unzip the zipped folder and place its contents within `\mobile\products\argos-template`.

## Finished
Open the `index-dev.html` file within `argos-template` to be greeted with the Home View. This runs it off the file system which is supported in many environments and browsers, however running from a local server is preferred. If your data provider is on a different domain then it needs to have CORS enabled in order to do development:

[Setting up CORS](https://github.com/Sage/argos-sdk/wiki/Setting-Up-CORS)

## Caching
Caching is when the browser stores requests and information inbetween sessions. This is undesirable for development so you may wish to see the [Browser Setup page](Browser-Setup.html) for instructions on disabling cache, opening and using the console and possible plugins which may be helpful.
