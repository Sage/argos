#Argos-Template Guide

By the end of this guide you will have an enterprise data-driven mobile application with the following:

* A Home Navigation page;
* Two List, or Collection, Views bound to different entities;
* A Detail View showing in depth properties, a single quick action and a link to a related List View; and
* A dual-purpose Edit View used to create and update entities.

As you are following along the guide will cover topics such as: Configuring SData, AMD loading and Simplates. From start to finish the 
guide should take around 15-20 minutes to complete and there are many more advanced topics to address specific implementations.


##Setup
The Argos framework is meant to serve in an environment of multiple on-going applications and their modules, as such the folder 
structure allows a single copy of Argos-SDK. You may opt for a different structure but the following provides an extensible foundation.

1\. Create a folder called `mobile` and within that, create a folder called `argos-sdk` and a folder called `products`.

2\. You should now have `\mobile`, `\mobile\argos-sdk` and `\mobile\products`. 

{@img setup_folders.png Folder Structure}

3\. All applications will be a new folder within `products`.

4\. Download the SDK and extract the zip into the `argos-sdk` folder: [https://github.com/Sage/argos-sdk/zipball/2.0](https://github.com/Sage/argos-sdk/zipball/2.0) 

5\. A bare-bones app that this guide will use as a kickstarter has been created as Argos-Template. 
Download it from GitHub: [https://github.com/Sage/argos-template/zipball/master](https://github.com/Sage/argos-template/zipball/master)

6\. Create a new folder under `products` named `argos-template` and place the extracted contents there.

7\. Within the `argos-template` folder open `index-dev.html`.

{@img intro_home.png Folder Structure}


Congratulations you have your first Argos app!

If you want to know about all the files you downloaded, see [Overview](#!/guide/v2_overview) - for an explanation of all files and 
folders currently in `argos-template`.

####Local Files
Running `index-dev.html` off the local file system may not always work as files loaded in this way is treated as a security concern in 
certain browsers. You should setup a local server (ISS, WAMP, XAMPP, etc) and run from localhost.

####Cache
Be aware that modern browsers cache things heavily and you should make sure that when opening or refreshing your app it is always 
the latest code. Many use "private" browsing features to disable cookies and cache. If using a local server make sure it is also set to not cache any files. 


##Configuring an SData Connection

SData is the lifeblood of Argos-SDK, all data input and output are bound to the protocol and the base List, Detail and Edit Views 
process and construct the data bound calls in SData format.

To set up the service that all calls will use we will point to a public provider with sample data and test user.

1\. Open `argos-template/configuration/development.js`

    define('configuration/development', ['Mobile/Template/ApplicationModule'], function(ApplicationModule) {

        return {
            modules: [
                new ApplicationModule()
            ],
            connections: {
                'crm': {
                    isDefault: true,
                    offline: true,
                    url: '',
                    json: true
                }
            }
        };

    });

2\. The configuration should return an object containing the `connections` key. That is where all SData connections will be defined.

3\. Within the `connections` object, each key will define a service. Currently there is a `crm` service with an empty url, edit it to 
point to our sample provider: 

    http://50.16.242.109/sdata/slx/dynamic/-/

4\. Now add two new keys: username and password and set them to `'lee'` and `''` (blank) respectively:

        connections: {
            'crm': {
                isDefault: true,
                offline: true,
                userName: 'lee',
                password: '',
                url: 'http://50.16.242.109/sdata/slx/dynamic/-/',
                json: true
            }
        }

5\. SData is fully configured and we are now ready to start creating views that retrieve data.


##Create a Simple List View

###List Views
List Views are all about presenting large amounts of data in an easy to read list format. Generally each list item will take you to a Detail View for that item.

When making any new Views you need to do two things:

1\. Code the view; and

2\. Register the view in `ApplicationModule.js`.

###Step 1: Coding a List View
List Views are designed to display a collection or list of a single entity. Some examples include: employees, artists, bug reports or sales orders.

For our entity choice we will be making a List (and Detail, Edit) View of the entity "Account" which uses the SData endpoint "accounts".

1\. Create a new folder in `argos-template\src\Views` named "Account".

2\. Create an empty file named `List.js` into `argos-template\src\Views\Account\` and open it up.

3\. First we setup the declare and define according the AMD standard. For more information see [Appendix: AMD](#!/guide/v2_appendix_amd).

    define('Mobile/Template/Views/Account/List', [
        'dojo/_base/declare',
        'dojo/string',
        'Sage/Platform/Mobile/List'
    ], function(
        declare,
        string,
        List
    ) {
        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.List', [List], {
        });
    });

    
4\. All views have a `titleText` and `id` property so let's define those first. The id standard for list is "entity_list" - so ours is `account_list`.

        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.List', [List], {
            // Localization
            titleText: 'Account List',
        
            // View Properties
            id: 'account_list'
        });

        
5\. Add the `icon` property and it set to `'content/images/icons/Company_24.png'`. The `icon` will be used by our `Home` View.


        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.List', [List], {
            // Localization
            titleText: 'Account List',
        
            // View Properties
            id: 'account_list',
            icon: 'content/images/icons/Company_24.png'
        });

        
6\. Now for the data. The List view was several properties that control what data is retrieved: resourceKind, querySelect and queryOrderBy.

* resourceKind to `'accounts'`. Entity/endpoint name.
* querySelect to an array of strings for: `AccountName`, `AccountManager/UserInfo/UserName`. Fields of the entity that will be returned.
* queryOrderBy to `'AccountName asc'`. Server-side ordering.

        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.List', [List], {
            // Localization
            titleText: 'Account List',
        
            // View Properties
            id: 'account_list',
            icon: 'content/images/icons/Company_24.png',
            resourceKind: 'accounts',
            querySelect: [
                'AccountName',
                'AccountManager/UserInfo/Username'
            ],
            queryOrderBy: 'AccountName asc'
        });

        
7\. Every row is constructed by a List Views `itemTemplate` property. All templates use Simplate, which is a templating engine where 
the item entry and the list view is passed as variables: `$` and `$$`. See {@link Simplate Simplate} for more information on the template engine.

8\. Add the following itemTemplate to your view:

            // Templates
            itemTemplate: new Simplate([
                '<h3>{%: $.AccountName %}</h3>',
                '<h4>{%: $.AccountManager && $.AccountManager.UserInfo ? $.AccountManager.UserInfo.UserName : "" %}</h4>'
            ])

11\. Save your List view file, before it will be loaded in the app we need to register it in ApplicationModule. 

###Step 2: Register the View
Before any view or module is loaded into the application (via AMD) it needs to be:

* added as a dependency;
* verify the reference is passed in; and
* registered via the `ApplicationModule.registerView()` function.

1\. Open `argos-template/src/ApplicationModule.js` and edit the define function to pull in our new List view:

    define('Mobile/Template/ApplicationModule', [
        /* trimmed for example */
        'Mobile/Template/Views/Account/List',
    ], function(
        /* trimmed for example */
        AccountList
    ) {

    
2\. Go to the `loadViews()` function, as you can see it is already registering the Home page. Following the same setup go ahead and 
register your list view using the referenced variable:

                this.registerView(new AccountList());

3\. Save the file.

Your view is now defined and registered and will be created, initialized and added to the DOM when your application starts.

###Step 3: Quick Peek
If you open `index-dev.html` right now you will see the blank Home view and no way to get to the List view. However, we can take a 
quick peek and directly go to the view - this trick is useful for developing and debugging views.

1\. Open `index-dev.html`.

2\. Open your javascript console. See [Browsers Help](#!/guide/v2_appendix_browser-setup) for the shortcut key for your chosen browser.

3\. Type in: `App.getView('account_list').show()`

4\. Press enter.

{@img list-trick.png List Trick}

Without going into too much detail the `App` namespace is glue that holds everything together and the line above is used to show any view.

Features seen in the Quick Peek: 

* View transition effect (slide) into place;
* Title bar with Back, Home and Add buttons;
* Search widget;
* Automatic paging (scroll down in the list to see Retrieve More);
* Navigation context and history (note the URL);
* Offline cache (inspect your local storage);
* Footer bar with Top and Copyright text; and
* Retrieved and rendered out 20 accounts.

The above is the default behavior - every piece is customizable so that you can tailor it to your business needs.


##Adding a List View to the Home Page
With a List view defined lets add a link to it on the Home page.

1\. Open `argos-template/src/Application.js` and find the the `getDefaultViews` function. This function returns a list of view ids that 
should be on the Home screen by default. Add your new view id to the list:

            getDefaultViews: function() {
                return [
                    'account_list'
                ];
            },

            
2\. Save and open `argos-template/index-dev.html`.

{@img list-home.png List on Home View}

The icon displayed came from the `icon` property defined on the list view.

Clicking the row will take you to your Account List view where it will automatically construct an SData request, parse and present the
 results using `itemTemplate` and use a simple paging mechanism.


##Create a Simple Detail View
Detail Views are intended to display a wealth of knowledge all categorically organized with helpful actions and links to perform on this 
entry or take you to ones related.

Creating a Detail View is very similar to creating a List in that you need to do three things:

1\. Code the Detail View;

2\. Register the view; and

3\. Wire the List View to the Detail View.

###Step 1: Coding a Detail View
1\. Create an empty file named `Detail.js` into `argos-template\src\Views\Account\` and open it up.

2\. First we setup the declare and define according the AMD standard. For more information see [Appendix: AMD](#!/guide/v2_appendix_amd).

    define('Mobile/Template/Views/Account/Detail', [
        'dojo/_base/declare',
        'dojo/string',
        'Sage/Platform/Mobile/Detail'
    ], function(
        declare,
        string,
        Detail
    ) {
        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.Detail', [Detail], {
        });
    });

    
3\. All views have a `titleText` and `id` property so let's define those first. The id standard for detail is "entity_detail" making this one `account_detail`.

        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.Detail', [Detail], {
            // Localization
            titleText: 'Account Detail',
        
            // View Properties
            id: 'account_detail'
        });

4\. Now for the data. The two detail view properties we need are: resourceKind and querySelect. The resource kind is the endpoint of 
our entity and querySelect tells the request what fields we need.

* resourceKind to `'accounts'`
* querySelect to an array of strings for: `AccountName`, `AccountManager/UserInfo/*`, `WebAddress`, `MainPhone`, and `Industry`

        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.Detail', [Detail], {
            // Localization
            titleText: 'Account Detail',
        
            // View Properties
            id: 'account_detail',
            resourceKind: 'accounts',
            querySelect: [
                'AccountName',
                'AccountManager/UserInfo/*',
                'WebAddress',
                'MainPhone',
                'Industry'
            ]
        });

5\. All Detail views must define a `createLayout()` function that defines the view `layout` property. The property `layout` is an array 
of "section" objects. Each section has a property named "children" which in turn is an array of "row" objects.

The sections get turned into collapsible headers with the children being the rows of information under that header.

    // section example
    {
        title: 'Section Header',
        name: 'SectionUniqueId',
        children: [/* rows */]
    }
    
    // row example
    {
        name: 'UniqueRowId',
        property: 'DataBoundProperty',
        label: 'Label shown in user interface'
    }

6\. The row objects `property` property should match up with your `querySelect`s, this ties the data from the SData response to the
 displayed row to the user. Further options for layout are covered in [Advanced Detail Create Layout](#!/guide/v2_beyond_the_guide_detail_layout_properties). 

7\. To utilize localization utilities of Argos all the row labels and section titles are defined as a property of the view and suffixed with 
`Text`. Any text string that is shown to the user should be defined this way.

            createLayout: function() {
                return this.layout || (this.layout = [{
                    title: this.detailsText,
                    name: 'DetailsSection',
                    children: [{
                        name: 'AccountName',
                        property: 'AccountName',
                        label: this.accountNameText
                    },{
                        name: 'Industry',
                        property: 'Industry',
                        label: this.industryText
                    },{
                        name: 'AccountManager',
                        property: 'AccountManager.UserInfo',
                        label: this.accountManagerText
                    }]
               },{
                    title: this.contactInfoText,
                    name: 'ContactInfoSection',
                    children: [{
                        name: 'WebAddress',
                        property: 'WebAddress',
                        label: this.webAddressText
                    },{
                        name: 'MainPhone',
                        property: 'MainPhone',
                        label: this.mainPhoneText
                    }]
                }]);
            }

            
8\. And add the localization strings for our labels/titles up near the titleText:

    titleText: 'Account Detail',
    accountNameText: 'account',
    industryText: 'business',
    accountManagerText: 'manager',
    webAddressText: 'web',
    mainPhoneText: 'phone',
    detailsText: 'Details',
    contactInfoText: 'Contact Info',

    
9\. That's it for a simple Detail View definition. Save your file.


###Step 2: Register the View
As with all new views they must be registered in order to be loaded into the application.


1\. Open `argos-tempate/src/ApplicationModule.js` and add our new view as a dependency, making sure the reference is pulled in:

    define('Mobile/Template/ApplicationModule', [
        /* trimmed for example */
        'Mobile/Template/Views/Account/List',
        'Mobile/Template/Views/Account/Detail'
    ], function(
       /* trimmed for example */
       AccountList,
       AccountDetail
    ) {

    
2\. Under `loadViews()` register our view using the reference variable.

                this.registerView(new AccountList());
                this.registerView(new AccountDetail());

3\. Save the file.

###Step 3: Wire List to Detail
Our Account List View does not know about the Account Detail View so let's add that relationship.

1\. Open `argos-template/src/Views/Account/List.js`.

2\. Near `id`, add the property `detailView` and set it to our detail id: `account_detail`:

        id: 'account_list',
        detailView: 'account_detail',

3\. Save and open your `index-dev.html` file.

4\. Navigate to Accounts, then select an Account to see your detail view


{@img detail-view.png Detail View}

(Details may vary)

For further details on how the wiring works please see [Wiring List to Detail](#!/guide/v2_appendix_wire_list_to_detail).

As you can see several of the fields don't look as they should, the phone number isn't formatted, the website isn't a hyperlink and the name 
just says Object. These rows require some additional properties in order to render correctly.

##Detail Layouts: Renderer and Template
Each row in a detail layout has the `renderer` property available which is used a "presenter". It takes the existing value and changes the
 rendered format without modifying the value underneath. Some examples are addresses, dates, clickable URLs, boolean to yes/no text, and others. 

Currently on our Detail View we have: an unclickable url and a name as `[Object object]`.

###Step 1: URLs
Argos-SDK provides a number of built-in formatters available via `Sage.Platform.Mobile.Format` which has a `link` formatter.


1\. Open `argos-template/src/Detail/Account/Detail.js`.

2\. Since we are using the Format module found in the SDK add that as a dependency and reference:

    define('Mobile/Template/Views/Account/Detail', [
        'dojo/_base/declare',
        'dojo/string',
        'Sage/Platform/Mobile/Format',
        'Sage/Platform/Mobile/Detail'
    ], function(
        declare,
        string,
        format,
        Detail
    ) {

3\. Go down to the `createLayout()` function and to the WebAddress row object.

4\. Add the new key `renderer` and set to `format.link`:

                  children: [{
                      name: 'WebAddress',
                      property: 'WebAddress',
                      label: this.webAddressText,
                      renderer: format.link
                  },{

5\. Save and run your app and go to an Account Detail entry. The web address is now underlined and upon clicking opens the URL.

{@img detail-link.png Detail Link}

###Step 2: Objects
The reason the row shows `[Object object]` is because the value for that SData property is actually a JSON object. In this case it's returning 
a 1:1 relation with an `owner` entity.

To show the properties that we want we could either use `renderer` and provide a function that handles the object or we could use: 

`template` - passes the current value as `$` to the defined {@link Simplate Simplate} and the result is displayed in the row.

1\. Back to `argos-template/src/Detail/Account/Detail.js` and down to the `createLayout()` function.

2\. For the `AccountManager` row add the key `tpl` (or `template`) with the value `this.userInfoNameTemplate`:

                },{
                    name: 'AccountManager',
                    property: 'AccountManager.UserInfo',
                    label: this.accountManagerText,
                    tpl: this.userInfoNameTemplate
                }]

3\. Now near the top of your code, near `id` and the localizations, add the `userInfoNameTemplate` as follows:

    userInfoNameTemplate: new Simplate([
        '{% if ($) { %}',
            '{% if ($.LastName && $.FirstName) { %}',
                '{%: $.LastName %}, {%= $.FirstName%}',
            '{% } else { %}',
                '{%: $.LastName ? $.LastName : $.FirstName %}',
            '{% } %}',
        '{% } %}'
    ]),

    
4\. To go over what is happening: it uses two Simplate techniques: `{% executable code %}` and `{%: encoded text %}`. To write it out the
 logic: if we have an object and the object has a LastName and FirstName property join with a comma, else put whichever one we do have. 
 In this context `$` is the object from SData and `$$` is the Detail View instance.

5\. Save and open your app to any Detail view.

{@img detail-template.png Detail Template}


##Create a Simple Edit View
Edit Views are dual purpose: Creating (POST) and Updating (PUT), the mode is determined by the navigations options.

As with the Detail View the each Edit View is a single "page" that clears it's values and applies the current entry.

Edit Views take a few extra steps to get up and running:

1\. Code the view;

2\. Register the View;

3\. Wire the Detail View to the Edit View; and

4\. Wire the List View to the Edit View.

###Step 1: Coding an Edit View
1\. Create an empty file named `Edit.js` into `argos-template\src\Views\Account\` and open it up.

2\. First we setup the declare and define according the AMD standard. For more information see [Appendix: AMD](#!/guide/v2_appendix_amd).

    define('Mobile/Template/Views/Account/Edit', [
        'dojo/_base/declare',
        'dojo/string',
        'Sage/Platform/Mobile/Edit'
    ], function(
        declare,
        string,
        Edit
    ) {
        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.Edit', [Edit], {
        });
    });

3\. All views have a `titleText` and `id` property so let's define those first. The id standard for Edit is "entity_edit" meaning this view is `account_edit`.

        return declare('Mobile.Template.Views.Account.Edit', [Edit], {
            // Localization
            titleText: 'Account Edit',
        
            // View Properties
            id: 'account_edit'
        });

4\. Now for the data. The two Edit view properties we need are: `resourceKind` and `querySelect`. The resource kind is the endpoint of our
 entity and query select tells the request what fields we need. 

The reason for `querySelect` is because when we are inserting a new item it does a request for the SData defaults (`$template`) and these
 fields are the ones it will request and apply.

* resourceKind to `'accounts'`
* querySelect to the exact same as your Detail querySelect: `AccountName`, `AccountManager/UserInfo/*`, `WebAddress`, `MainPhone`, and `Industry`.

            // Localization
            titleText: 'Account Edit',
            
            // View Properties
            id: 'account_edit',
            resourceKind: 'accounts',
            querySelect: [
                'AccountName',
                'AccountManager/UserInfo/*',
                'WebAddress',
                'MainPhone',
                'Industry'
            ],

            
5\. All Edit views must define a `createLayout()` function that defines the view `layout` property. The property `layout` is an array 
of "field" objects. You can also have sections like Detail and have their `children` property as "field" objects but normally there are no sections.

    // field object example
    {
        label: 'text shown in ui',
        name: 'uniqueFieldId',
        property: 'data bound property',
        'default': 'default value', // optional
        type: 'field type'
        // additional properties related to the field type
    }

    
6\. `type` designates the type of field. Examples of field types are: `text`, `textarea`,
 `date`, `decimal`, `phone`, `lookup` and `boolean`. 

7\. Not only do field objects have the above properties but any further defined properties are passed to the field type instance. For 
example say we have a `decimal` field and we want the decimal places to go out to 4:

    {
        label: 'example',
        name: 'ExampleNumber',
        property: 'ExampleNumber',
        type: 'decimal',
        precision: 4
    }

    
8\. Each field type has their own custom properties and you can read more about each field in the {@link _Field API Docs}.

9\. Moving forward, here is the layout for our simple Edit view:

          createLayout: function() {
              return this.layout || (this.layout = [{
                      name: 'AccountName',
                      property: 'AccountName',
                      label: this.accountNameText,
                      type: 'text'
                  },{
                      name: 'AccountManager',
                      property: 'AccountManager',
                      label: this.accountManagerText,
                      type: 'text'
                  },{
                      name: 'Industry',
                      property: 'Industry',
                      label: this.industryText,
                      type: 'text'
                  },{
                      name: 'WebAddress',
                      property: 'WebAddress',
                      label: this.webAddressText,
                      type: 'text'
                  },{
                      name: 'MainPhone',
                      property: 'MainPhone',
                      label: this.mainPhoneText,
                      type: 'text'
                  }]
              );
          }

          
10\. As with the others go back and add the localization strings, since typically Detail and Edit mirror each other label-wise its often 
easy to just copy+paste from the Detail view:

    titleText: 'Account Edit',
    accountNameText: 'account',
    industryText: 'business',
    accountManagerText: 'manager',
    webAddressText: 'web',
    mainPhoneText: 'phone',

11\. Save your page, before it gets loaded into the App we need to register it.

###Step 2: Register the View
As with all new views they must be registered in order to be loaded into the application.

1\. Open `argos-tempate/src/ApplicationModule.js` and add our new view as a dependency, making sure the reference is pulled in:


    define('Mobile/Template/ApplicationModule', [
        /* trimmed for example */
        'Mobile/Template/Views/Account/List',
        'Mobile/Template/Views/Account/Detail',
        'Mobile/Template/Views/Account/Edit'
    ], function(
       /* trimmed for example */
       AccountList,
       AccountDetail,
       AccountEdit
    ) {

    
2\. Under `loadViews()` register our view using the reference variable.

                this.registerView(new AccountList());
                this.registerView(new AccountDetail());
                this.registerView(new AccountEdit());

3\. Save the file.

###Step 3: Wire Detail to Edit

1\. Open `argos-tempate/src/Views/Account/Detail.js` and near `id` add:

            editView: 'account_edit',

2\. Save and open your app. Go to a detail and click the Edit button in the toolbar.

{@img edit-view.png Edit View}

We'll get to sorting out the needed properties - just make sure you that the Detail and Edit Views are hooked together.

###Step 4: Wire List to Edit
1\. Open `argos-tempate/src/Views/Account/List.js` and near `detailView` add:

            insertView: 'account_edit',

2\. Save and open your app. Go the Account List View and click the green plus button to add a new account.

{@img edit-view-insert.png Edit View Insert}

####Additional Info
For more details on how the wiring for Edit Views work, including how it distinguishes Insert vs Update please see
 [Wire Detail to Edit](#!/guide/v2_beyond_the_guide_wire_detail_to_edit) and [Wire List to Edit](#!/guide/v2_beyond_the_guide_wire_list_to_edit).

Next we need to step through each of the field objects and assign the correct type while investigating any properties that field may introduce.

##Edit View Layouts
The Edit View currently has five text fields with only two that are actual text inputs - `AccountName` and `Industry`. 
The other three `AccountManager`, `MainPhone` and `WebAddress` should be changed:

* WebAddress to use the "www" keyboard input;
* MainPhone to the `phone` type; and
* AccountManager to the `lookup` type.

###Step 1: WebAddress Input Type
The text field adds a property named `inputType` which directly controls the `<input type="">` underneath. This is useful for 
utilizing the latest HTML5 keyboard types.

Currently only iOS supports the `url` keyboard providing quick keys for `.`, `/` and `.com`.

1\. Open `argos-template/src/Views/Account/Edit.js` and down to the WebAddress field.

2\. Add the `inputType` key set to `url`:

    },{
       name: 'WebAddress',
       property: 'WebAddress',
       label: this.webAddressText,
       type: 'text',
       inputType: 'url'
    },{

For more information and additional properties of the text field see it's {@link TextField API Docs}.


###Step 2: MainPhone as `phone`
Also provided by the SDK is the `phone` type field. This field formats valid phone numbers into a more human readable format 
and also changes the input keyboard for iOS to the `tel` board which resembles the calling a number keyboard.

1\. Open `argos-template/src/Views/Account/Edit.js` and down to the MainPhone field.

2\. Change `type` to `'phone'`

    },{
       name: 'MainPhone',
       property: 'MainPhone',
       label: this.mainPhoneText,
       type: 'phone'
    }]

For more information and additional properties of the phone field see it's {@link PhoneField API Docs}.

###Step 3: AccountManager as `lookup`
A `lookup` type field is one that takes the user to a different List View and let's them choose a row that is returned to the 
Edit view. This is how the user sets foreign key relationships on an entity.

1\. Open `argos-template/src/Views/Account/Edit.js` and down to the AccountManager field.

2\. Change `type` to `'lookup'`.

3\. If you recall from the Detail View the textual display came from `AccountManager.UserInfo.FirstName` and `.LastName`. 
The Lookup Field uses the `textProperty` and `textTemplate` to do the same functionality as before. Add the two keys 
and set them to `UserInfo` and `this.userInfoNameTemplate`:

    },{
       name: 'AccountManager',
       property: 'AccountManager',
       label: this.accountManagerText,
       textProperty: 'UserInfo',
       textTemplate: this.userInfoNameTemplate,
       type: 'lookup'
    },{

4\. What the above does is take the `AccountManager` object and its `UserInfo` field (which is also an object) and passes 
that to the Simplate defined in `textTemplate`. Go ahead and copy the `userInfoNameTemplate` from the Detail view to the Edit view:

            // Templates
            userInfoNameTemplate: new Simplate([
                '{% if ($) { %}',
                    '{% if ($.LastName && $.FirstName) { %}',
                        '{%: $.LastName %}, {%= $.FirstName%}',
                    '{% } else { %}',
                        '{%: $.LastName ? $.LastName : $.FirstName %}',
                    '{% } %}',
                '{% } %}'
            ]),

5\. Save Edit.js and open your app - we are not done but let's take a look at what we have so far, make sure to edit an 
existing entry to see the `textTemplate` in action.

{@img edit-progress.png Edit progress}

6\. If you are using an iOS device to test you can checkout the URL keyboard and the tel keyboard for `WebAddress` and 
`MainPhone`. Note that the `AccountManager` now has a magnifying glass icon - it doesn't do anything yet but it did render the name correctly.

7\. The last piece the lookup is telling it which List View it should go to. This is controlled by the `view` property, we don't 
have another List view yet but will will define one soon. For now add `view` and set it to `user_list`:

    },{
       name: 'AccountManager',
       property: 'AccountManager',
       label: this.accountManagerText,
       textProperty: 'UserInfo',
       textTemplate: this.userInfoNameTemplate,
       type: 'lookup',
       view: 'user_list'
    },{

8\. Save the `Account/Edit.js` file and create a new folder: `argos-template/src/Views/User` and add a `List.js` file.

9\. Create a new List view to `argos-template/src/Views/User/List.js` with the following properties:

            //Templates
            itemTemplate: new Simplate([
                '<h3>{%: $.UserInfo.LastName %}, {%: $.UserInfo.FirstName %}</h3>',
                '<h4>{%: $.UserInfo.Title %}</h4>'
            ]),

            //Localization
            titleText: 'Users',

            //View Properties
            id: 'user_list',
            queryOrderBy: 'UserInfo.LastName asc, UserInfo.FirstName asc',
            querySelect: [
                'UserInfo/FirstName',
                'UserInfo/LastName',
                'UserInfo/Title',
                'UserInfo/UserName'
            ],
            resourceKind: 'users'

10\. Don't forget to register the view. Save and open your app. Try either adding a new account or editing an existing one - use 
the lookup to select a different Account Manager from the User endpoint.
