#Edit View Layouts
Edit View layouts differ from Detail layouts in that most of the functionality is provided by the field the row contains, designated by the `type` property.

Another difference is that the Edit View layout is created once at startup (when the application starts up). The fields get cleared and re-set with data when showing different records but the HTML underneath never changes.

The layouts typically do not contain multiple sections separated by section bars, but it does support the same options as Detail in that regard.

Fields:
   * [_Field](_Field.html)
   * [Boolean Field](Boolean-Field.html)
   * [Date Field](Date-Field.html)
   * [Decimal Field](Decimal-Field.html)
   * [Duration Field](Duration-Field.html)
   * [Editor Field](Editor-Field.html)
   * [Hidden Field](Hidden-Field.html)
   * [Lookup Field](Lookup-Field.html)
   * [Phone Field](Phone-Field.html)
   * [Select Field](Select-Field.html)
   * [Signature Field](Signature-Field.html)
   * [Text Field](Text-Field.html)
   * [Text Area Field](Text-Area-Field.html)
